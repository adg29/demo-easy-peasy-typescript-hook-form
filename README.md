# easy-peasy-typescript

This is an example implementation of using Typescript with [Easy Peasy](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy). This grants you a fully typed global state solution for React, which abstracts all of the Redux boilerplate whilst still granting you access to all of its power.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy-typescript
cd easy-peasy-typescript
npm install
npm start
```
